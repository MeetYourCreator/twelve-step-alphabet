- Build meeting database from retrieved datasets
- Create functionality to allow users to search comprehensive directory of 12 step meetings
- Create functionality to allow users to create, update, and delete reviews of 12 step meetings

### Goals

- _Develop a working product as basis for future iterations of development, with the end goal of releasing the application on Apple's App store_
- _Refine recent advances in my React knowledge—including PropTypes for client-side error handling and React-JSS for dynamic CSS-through implementation in project development_
